## CI/CD

![cicd](https://blog.mergify.com/content/images/2022/03/CI-CD-infinity-copy-1.jpg)

 - Plan - doc / issue
 - [git] Code
 - [ci] * Build
 - [ci] * Test
 - [ci] * Release [github release]
 - [cd] Deploy [IaC / apps store]
 - [cd] Operate [controller / gitops / chatops]
 - [cd] Monitor [health check]

## Continuous integration

 - version control
   - commit message [check]
 - build
 - automated testing
   - lint
   - unittest
   - integration test
   - end-to-end test
 
## Continuous delivery / deployment

 - Deploy
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) / gitops
     - ansible (netdb) https://gitlab.com/19gale.ai/netdb-playbook
     - https://k21academy.com/ansible/terraform-vs-ansible/
 - Operate

## tools

### version control

- git

- github pull request (PR) / gitlab merge request (MR)
  - merge commit
  - squash
  - relation with issue tracker
- gitflow https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
  - develop / feature / main / release / hotfixes

![gitflow](https://nvie.com/img/git-model@2x.png)

### CI tools

- git trigger (webhook)
- worker
  - pipeline

#### ci tools type
##### job base (jenkins)
- agent (java based) / worker setup
- Groovy script
- https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/examples/
- plugins

##### code pipeline base (gitlab ci/circle ci)
- .gitlab-ci.yml
- rules - Use the rules keyword to specify when to run or skip jobs.
- cache / artifacts - Keep information across jobs and stages persistent in a pipeline with cache and artifacts. These keywords are ways to store dependencies and job output, even when using ephemeral runners for each job. 

![gitlab pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/img/pipeline_graph_v13_6.png)

```
build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Hello, $GITLAB_USER_LOGIN!"

test-job1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This job tests something"

test-job2:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This job tests something, but takes more time than test-job1."
    - echo "After the echo commands complete, it runs the sleep command for 20 seconds"
    - echo "which simulates a test that runs 20 seconds longer than test-job1"
    - sleep 20

deploy-prod:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "This job deploys something from the $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH branch."
  environment: production
```

##### ci market (github action)

- .github/workflows/xx.yml

```
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
